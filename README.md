Facebook Auto Like
==========

Set up
-----------

1. You'll need to install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) on your browser. There are other plug-ins that do the same, this is the one I like.
2. Install the [script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/186151)
3. This step is very important.
You'll see that the script on line 6 has "// @match       https://www.facebook.com/your-custom-url"
Replace the last part of that with your actual Facebook url.

Description
-----------

Will like all recent posts on your wall that have not been 'liked' yet. 

To Do 
-----------

- Make it only 'like' posts matching some string, for example 'happy birthday'
- I've only tested on Chrome on Windows.
